- 👋 Hi, I’m @cianlinehan.
- 👀 I’m interested in the tech and financial industries and like to keep up to date with the most recent and consequential events.
- 🌱 I’m currently a 3rd year studying Data Science and Analytics at University College Cork, Ireland.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find experience as an intern as part of my work placement programme in March 2022.
- 📫 How to reach me: by email; cianlinehan4@gmail.com.
- 🖥 To view some of my recent college projects, go to folder 'Recent Assignments'. Unfortunately I cannot show the work product of my most recent employment as a      Data Analyst Intern at the MaREI Institute, where I worked on the CHIMERA project for future climate change modelling.
